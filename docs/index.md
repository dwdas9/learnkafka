# Apache Kafka for Builders

## *Architect, Develop & Deploy Real-Time Apps*

Welcome to the most practical, hands-on guide to Apache Kafka. This course is designed for **builders** — developers, architects, and engineers who want to learn by doing.

---

## What Makes This Different?

!!! tip "Learning Philosophy"
    - **Build first, theory second** — Every concept is tied to a real project
    - **No fluff** — Only what you'll actually use in production
    - **Real architectures** — Learn from actual production patterns
    - **Code-heavy** — Docker setups, working examples, mini-projects

## Quick Start

New to Kafka? Start here:

1. **[Why Kafka?](part-1/01-why-kafka.md)** - Understand the problem it solves
2. **[Core Concepts](part-1/02-core-concepts.md)** - Topics, producers, consumers
3. **[10-Minute Setup](part-1/03-setup.md)** - Get Kafka running with Docker

Already know the basics? Jump to:

- **[Stream Processing](part-2/07-stream-processing.md)** for real-time analytics
- **[Design Patterns](part-3/09-design-patterns.md)** for architecture
- **[Production Guide](part-4/12-production.md)** for deployment

## What You'll Build

Throughout this course, you'll build **5 production-grade projects**:

| Project | Skills Learned |
|---------|---------------|
| **Real-time Order Tracking** | Producers, Consumers, Topics |
| **Inventory Sync System** | Event-driven Microservices |
| **Fraud Detection Pipeline** | Kafka Streams, Windowing |
| **Data Warehouse ETL** | Kafka Connect, Integrations |
| **Clickstream Analytics** | End-to-end Real-time Pipeline | ---

## How to Use This Guide

!!! note "Recommended Path"
    **For Beginners:** Follow the course sequentially from Part I → Part V
    
    **For Experienced Users:** Jump to relevant sections based on your needs
    
    **For Hands-on Learners:** Go directly to Part V projects and refer back as needed

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Java or Python preferred)
- Understanding of REST APIs and databases
- Docker installed (for hands-on labs)
- Terminal/command-line familiarity

No prior Kafka knowledge required!
