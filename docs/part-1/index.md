# Part I: Start Fast & Build Something

## Get Productive with Kafka Quickly

This section is designed to get you from **zero to building** in the shortest time possible. No theory overload - just the essentials you need to start creating real Kafka applications.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of Part I, you will:

- Understand **why Kafka exists** and when to use it
- Master the **core concepts** (topics, partitions, producers, consumers)
- Have Kafka **running locally** via Docker
- Build your **first producer and consumer** in code
- Complete **2 hands-on mini-projects**

## Hands-On Projects

Each chapter includes practical exercises, culminating in these mini-projects:

!!! example "Mini Project #1: Simple Event Pipeline"
    **Goal:** Build a basic producer → topic → consumer flow
    
    **Time:** ~30 minutes
    
    **Skills:** CLI tools, basic message flow

!!! example "Mini Project #2: Order Events System"
    **Goal:** Publisher sends order events → Analytics consumer processes them
    
    **Time:** ~1 hour
    
    **Skills:** Programming producers/consumers, handling events

---
