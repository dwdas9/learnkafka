## 🏗️ Architecture

graph TB
    O[Order Service] -->|order.placed| K[Kafka]
    K -->|consume| I[Inventory Service]
    I -->|inventory.reserved| K
    I -->|inventory.released| K
    K --> W[Warehouse Service]
    K --> A[Analytics Service]
```

## 📋 What You'll Learn

- Event-driven choreography
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Compensating transactions
- Event sourcing basics
- Idempotent consumers

---

## 💻 Implementation

### Events

- `inventory.reserve-requested`
- `inventory.reserved`
- `inventory.insufficient`
- `inventory.released`

### Services

1. **Order Service** — Initiates reservations
2. **Inventory Service** — Manages stock levels
3. **Warehouse Service** — Physical fulfillment
4. **Compensation Service** — Handles rollbacks

---

## 🎯 Challenges

- Handle concurrent reservations
- Implement idempotency (same request twice)
- Compensating actions on failures
